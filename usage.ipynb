A couple years later brought Pinkerton, an album that was shunned by most reviewers at release. While I may be \"too young\" to understand Weezer's impact on music at time of release, I can tell you that I know as much as any other older fan knows about the band. With that said, I have NO problem saying that this is the best record the band has made since Pinkerton. I am able to find high points in every record released, but I am also able to point out the lowpoints. This record has NO lowpoints. Sure, Back to the Shack may not be the greatest song ever released, but when listened to with the rest of the album, it sounds great. \"Ain't Got Nobody\" is the perfect opener, giving casual l that isteners a taste of the old Weezer that we have all longed for, mixed with a new energy. \"Eulogy For A Rock Band\" seems to be a homage to older bands that don't know when to quit (insert Weezer is too old joke here; they're not). \"Lonely Girl\" is a must-listen to any die-hard \"Green\" album fans. \"I've Had It Up To Here\" is an amazing song from all aspects, on my first listen, the falsettos by Rivers had me star struck. He's hit high notes before, but this is completely new. \"The British Are Coming\" is a lyrically playful, yet well put together song. I feel as if this may be the best composed song of them all, instrumentally speaking. \"Da Vinci\" and \"Go Away\" are some of my favorites, and should definitely be played on the radio, as they appeal to pop / alt / rock genres, without crossing into one genre alone. \"Cleopatra\" is a very unique song, with changes in time signature that could confuse the listener immediately. With that said, the solo sounds very Iron Maiden-esque to me (just my interpretation). Now on to \"Foolish Father\". Wow. I see this song as the closer of the album, even though there are three songs that follow. Sure, the song may seem a little \"weird\" at times, but for any \"Blue\" / \"Pinkerton\" fan, this song closes doors that were opened long ago. True Weezer fans understand what the father figure plays in the classic \"Say It Ain't So\", and this song is a complete 180 from that. If you're someone who values lyrics as much, or more than the instrumentals themselves, I recommend really listening to this song. Next comes \"The Futurescope Trilogy\". This is an entrance to a dimension that Weezer has never explored before. Consisting of three songs (only one having lyrics), it answers the question \"can Rivers really shred?\". The answer is yes. Thats all I want to give away. Please, PLEASE, listen to this album with an open mind. It is definitely in the top three for me, and a lot of other fans.… Expand</td>\n",

This album is not great, but it is not awful, and it is criminally underrated. Not only is it underrated, but it is over-hated.

The lyrics on this and the last few albums sound like mediocre middle school poetry. There are also multiple musical/stylistic faults I found with this album. For instance, the guitar solo starting around the 2-minute mark of In the Mall sounds so similar to the guitar solo of Rush's Tom Sawyer. Search it up. It's ridiculous. (Not to mention the track also has an obnoxiously loud main riff that doesn't remind me of going to the mall ever.) Also, noting that one track, Love Is the Answer is a 'Hindi Version' of a song on Spotify could not be more offensive, and I'm not even Hindi. The last thing this album needed was a racial song title. This album is full of flaws, and it deserves to be criticized.… Expand</td>\n",

This is not the Weezer album I had hoped for after hearing \"Pork and Beans\" for the last month. \"Troublemaker,\" while making it clear as day that Rivers Cuomo is no longer a skillful lyricist, is still a fun song. It doesn't have any depth whatsoever, but who cares? It's a good Weezer song. The verse in \"Everybody Get Dangerous\" is Cuomo's best stab at anything hip-hop since the vocals of \"El Scorcho.\" \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" starts off as a pretty awesome song, but past the first three minutes, it becomes one great big black mark on the whole album. Rivers tried to make his own \"Jesus of Suburbia,\" to a lesser extent, and it falls flat on its face. The jerky turn-arounds left and right in its six minute runtime completely throw (and in my case, turn) the listener off. \"Dreamin',\" while not as extreme, has some very awkward, uncomfortable structural issues (although I won't deny that it's kind of rockin'). \"Thought I Knew\" is a throwaway track and a disappointment for those looking forward to hear what the other members of Weezer are capable of. \"Automatic\" is a little better, but nothing great. I think Cuomo is better off going with the whole control freak thing. \"The Red Album\" is a great improvement over \"Make Believe\" and even a step or two above \"Maladroit.\" If nothing else, it serves as a very interesting record to the band's fanbase. Sadly, instead of the triumphant return we've been hoping for, this is more so the final nail in the coffin---Weezer is never coming back. Few tracks can be identifiable to the band's crunchy pop-rock of the nineties, and Cuomo and Co. don't seem to be looking back.

       "318  This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\\n        \\n1994 brought the Blue album. I was barely a month old when the album released. A couple years later brought Pinkerton, an album that was shunned by most reviewers at release. While I may be \"too young\" to understand Weezer's impact on music at time of release, I can tell you that I know as much as any other older fan knows about the band. With that said, I have NO problem saying that this is the best record the band has made since Pinkerton. I am able to find high points in every record released, but I am also able to point out the lowpoints. This record has NO lowpoints. Sure, Back to the Shack may not be the greatest song ever released, but when listened to with the rest of the album, it sounds great. \"Ain't Got Nobody\" is the perfect opener, giving casual l that isteners a taste of the old Weezer that we have all longed for, mixed with a new energy. \"Eulogy For A Rock Band\" seems to be a homage to older bands that don't know when to quit (insert Weezer is too old joke here; they're not). \"Lonely Girl\" is a must-listen to any die-hard \"Green\" album fans. \"I've Had It Up To Here\" is an amazing song from all aspects, on my first listen, the falsettos by Rivers had me star struck. He's hit high notes before, but this is completely new. \"The British Are Coming\" is a lyrically playful, yet well put together song. I feel as if this may be the best composed song of them all, instrumentally speaking. \"Da Vinci\" and \"Go Away\" are some of my favorites, and should definitely be played on the radio, as they appeal to pop / alt / rock genres, without crossing into one genre alone. \"Cleopatra\" is a very unique song, with changes in time signature that could confuse the listener immediately. With that said, the solo sounds very Iron Maiden-esque to me (just my interpretation). Now on to \"Foolish Father\". Wow. I see this song as the closer of the album, even though there are three songs that follow. Sure, the song may seem a little \"weird\" at times, but for any \"Blue\" / \"Pinkerton\" fan, this song closes doors that were opened long ago. True Weezer fans understand what the father figure plays in the classic \"Say It Ain't So\", and this song is a complete 180 from that. If you're someone who values lyrics as much, or more than the instrumentals themselves, I recommend really listening to this song. Next comes \"The Futurescope Trilogy\". This is an entrance to a dimension that Weezer has never explored before. Consisting of three songs (only one having lyrics), it answers the question \"can Rivers really shred?\". The answer is yes. Thats all I want to give away. Please, PLEASE, listen to this album with an open mind. It is definitely in the top three for me, and a lot of other fans.… Expand   \n",
       "208  People don't realize that this is inspired by modern-pop, not meant to pander to those who listen to modern pop exclusively. People also don't realize that this is experimental, which means that the music put out by Weezer will sound different each time, as it has in the past 23 years.

Comparing this to Raditude is unfair, because within the context of 2017 pop, this sounds more like Make Believe. Most fans look back at the mid-late 2000's as one big pile of garbage, but if you actually take the time to listen to each of the albums, you will hear that each one sounds different than the last, and the so-called \"fans\" don't want Weezer to make anything that sounds different than what they're used to. This album is not great, but it is not awful, and it is criminally underrated. Not only is it underrated, but it is over-hated. Stop judging this album based on your prior beliefs and what other people have already said, but start actually using your brain and thinking about whether something that sounds different sounds good or bad, or just okay.… Expand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "538  Once again, there isn't really an excellent song anywhere on this album, as with the last few Weezer albums starting with Make Believe. The best obviously being If You're Wondering if I Want You To (I Want You To). The lyrics are painfully forced. Every rhyme makes me think of Cuomo sitting at a table and thinking, \"What rhymes with 'had'? OF COURSE! 'Sad!'\" Like seriously.

Every rhyme makes me think of Cuomo sitting at a table and thinking, \"What rhymes with 'had'? OF COURSE! 'Sad!'\" Like seriously. The lyrics on this and the last few albums sound like mediocre middle school poetry. There are also multiple musical/stylistic faults I found with this album. For instance, the guitar solo starting around the 2-minute mark of In the Mall sounds so similar to the guitar solo of Rush's Tom Sawyer. Search it up. It's ridiculous. (Not to mention the track also has an obnoxiously loud main riff that doesn't remind me of going to the mall ever.) Also, noting that one track, Love Is the Answer is a 'Hindi Version' of a song on Spotify could not be more offensive, and I'm not even Hindi.

We should be talking about the majority of the album, highlights. Immediately from California Kids' deep guitar and pounding drums in the chorus.

Not to mention how uniquely sad, but upbeat Jacked Up is (another one of my favorites).\\r Of course we can't forget to mention those other singles. Thank God For Girls seems to fit even better now that it has it's place in the album, and L.A. Girlz is a perfect lead in to Jacked Up. King Of The World stands out most as a true homage to everything Weezer is.

It's not too overpowering, but it is enough to stay interesting and fresh when compared to other albums the band has put out in the 90's.  Kind of like how EWBAITE ended with that long epic guitar finale!  So it seems like Weezer have found a formula that keeps their classic sound while trying new things and experimenting a little bit here and there.  But \"Thank God for Girls\" is just really stupid and annoying.  But that is the only track I don't like.  The rest of the album is very solid.  \"King of the World\", \"Do You Wanna Get High?\", \"California Kids\", and \"Endless Bummer\" are my favorite tracks.  So overall, I'd definitely suggest picking this up if you liked Weezer's last album and if you like their first two albums.  This is probably my 4th favorite Weezer album!

Halfway through the album, the Pinkerton sounding single \"Do You Wanna Get High?\" convinces the listener to listen to the rest of the album, and they aren't disappointed. The album's final three tracks (L.A. Girlz, Jacked Up and Endless Bummer) solidify the album as one of the band's best. L.A. Girlz, a rock anthem to the girls of Los Angeles, is arguably one of the band's best songs, regardless of album. Jacked Up is an uplifting love song and Endless Bummer closes out the album by capturing the feelings of going back to school for younger listeners and reminiscing about a summer relationship perfectly.\\rNot only is \"The White Album\" one of the best power pop albums of the year, it's one of the band's top 5 albums ever released.… Expand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

It has a lot of decent tracks, but no great ones, and little flow. This is not the Weezer album I had hoped for after hearing \"Pork and Beans\" for the last month. \"Troublemaker,\" while making it clear as day that Rivers Cuomo is no longer a skillful lyricist, is still a fun song. It doesn't have any depth whatsoever, but who cares? It's a good Weezer song. The verse in \"Everybody Get Dangerous\" is Cuomo's best stab at anything hip-hop since the vocals of \"El Scorcho.\" \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" starts off as a pretty awesome song, but past the first three minutes, it becomes one great big black mark on the whole album. Rivers tried to make his own \"Jesus of Suburbia,\" to a lesser extent, and it falls flat on its face. The jerky turn-arounds left and right in its six minute runtime completely throw (and in my case, turn) the listener off. \"Dreamin',\" while not as extreme, has some very awkward, uncomfortable structural issues (although I won't deny that it's kind of rockin'). \"Thought I Knew\" is a throwaway track and a disappointment for those looking forward to hear what the other members of Weezer are capable of. \"Automatic\" is a little better, but nothing great. I think Cuomo is better off going with the whole control freak thing. \"The Red Album\" is a great improvement over \"Make Believe\" and even a step or two above \"Maladroit.\" If nothing else, it serves as a very interesting record to the band's fanbase. Sadly, instead of the triumphant return we've been hoping for, this is more so the final nail in the coffin---Weezer is never coming back. Few tracks can be identifiable to the band's crunchy pop-rock of the nineties, and Cuomo and Co. don't seem to be looking back. If this \"different\" music was better, I wouldn't be complaining.… Expand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
